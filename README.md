Suppose you have data on output and factors of production from a random sample of firms with the same production function:

Y equals A K to the power of a L to the power of b u comma

where Y denotes output, K denotes capital, L denotes labor, u is an error term, and A, a, and b are production parameters.

(a) Write a linear regression that can estimate A, a, and b.

(b) Rearrange the regression so that you can test the null hypothesis of constant returns to scale, i.e., a+b=1, against a two-sided alternative by testing the null that the population coefficient on L in your modified regression equals 0 against a two-sided alternative.
